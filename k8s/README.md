**Note on Kubernetes deployment**

Please, pay attention that usually the deployment happens via HELM chart which also included o3api. The HELM Chart is located at [o3k8s](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/m-team/o3as/o3k8s) repository.


o3k8s directory here contains example YAML files for direct deployment of the o3webapp in Kubernetes
